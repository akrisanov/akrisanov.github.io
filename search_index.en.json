any modern project where there is a need to process events – a set of messages or a stream of\ndata – developers often propose Apache Kafka as the infrastructure solution. This is not always a\nweighted choice – where a classic broker like ActiveMQ will do, marketing sometimes prevails.\nBut let's assume that you have deliberately chosen Kafka, or that the infrastructure team has\nleft you no alternative. Before setting up broker parameters and writing producers and consumers,\nwhat questions should you ask yourself? To ensure a smooth start, I have prepared the following\nchecklist:\nThe amount of data that is going to be generated by the producers →\nWill the network channel be sufficient for the entire system and its critical components?\nIs there an option to make use of message compression?\nData retention policy:\nHow long do you need to keep data? → Consider the business and data protection requirements of\na product you are developing, and the cost of storing data.\nMessage sending guarantees (Acks) →\nFinding the right balance between latency and reliability within replication (durability).\nMessage delivery guarantees → How critical is message loss or duplication of messages to\nthe business objective? Are idempotency\nand transactionality needed?\nWhat partitioning strategy will producers use? →\nIs the default strategy (Default partitioner) appropriate?\nFor a particular topic, is it important to store the entire message log, or are the latest\nchanges sufficient → Consider using Compacted\ntopics.\nDo the created topics require a consumer group? →\nHow do you plan to scale consumers and their bandwidth? What happens when the group is\nrebalanced?\nThat's it. The checklist/questionnaire is by no means exhaustive and it only covers the essentials.\nIt leaves out a lot of things such as data encryption, authentication, authorization, and cluster\nconfiguration – assuming that the SRE team or some PAAS will take care of that for you.","description":"You're starting a new project with Apache Kafka.

Apart from general curiosity, I was interested in\nhow they achieved security in a browser, especially in the age of extensions and\nclient-side vulnerabilities.\nIt turned out that when a user logged in, the wallet application (built in React) generated a set\nof public and private keys and stored them in the browser's local storage. With my experience of\nbuilding authentication and authorization in distributed systems, I knew this was not the best\nthing to do – in general, it's easy for a browser extension and client-side code to read data\nfrom local storage 1.\nTo prove this, I decided to write a simple extension for Chrome that would retrieve keys from a victim's browser and send them to my\nanonymous email address.\nThe root directory of my pickpocket extension looked like this:\nThe main files are the manifest.json and content.js. The former is essential for installing the extension.\nemail.min.js is just a client library from one of the cloud services that allows you to send\nemail directly from a browser without any server code. index.html is a blank HTML page that\ndisplays nothing. The wallet hijacking logic lived in the content.js file:\nYes, such a dummy script.\nI packed all four files into a zip archive and kindly asked my friend, who also had\na wallet at https://wallet.***.org, to install my creation in his browser\n(pretending to do some social engineering). Before doing so, I told him about my findings and\nthe theory I was trying to prove. He was happy to help, and the public and private keys of\nthis wallet account appeared in my inbox a few seconds after the browser extension was installed.\nNext, I saved the keys to local storage in my browser and opened the wallet website.\nSurprisingly, my friend's crypto-wallet balance was available to me, along with an option to\nwithdraw the funds. During a Zoom call with my victim friend, I transferred some of his funds to\nan anonymous account and back. It was mind-blowing! A new, promising blockchain that had recently\nclosed an investment round had a major vulnerability in its wallet. Worst of all, they had 2-factor\nauthentication for users. Of course, not many people would activate it right away, and many didn't.\nAs an ethical developer, I created a vulnerability report, including the source code of\nthe browser extension and my thoughts on how to improve the security of the web application.\nIt was sent directly to the security team's email address on 18th of January. A few days later,\nI had a call with the CISO of the blockchain protocol, who assured me that they were aware of\nthe issue and would address it in the next release. I was a little disappointed with the speed of\nthe response to the incident. Two days is an eternity when one speaks about users' money.\nNevertheless, the blockchain developers granted me their tokens in an amount equivalent to 1,000 USDT.\nAdvice for application developers: be aware of the technologies you use and their security aspects.\nAdvice for crypto users: learn what security options an organisation offers to you,\nactivate two-factor authentication as soon as you create a wallet account, don't store all of\nyour funds in hot wallets.\n1\nWorth reading:\nIs LocalStorage safe to use? | Snyk\nPlease Stop Using Local Storage\nUsing HTTP cookies - HTTP | MDN\nHttpOnly | OWASP Foundation","description":"On joining the community of one of the proof-of-stake blockchains and finding a client vulnerability in its wallet app.","id":"https://akrisanov.com/crypto-wallet-vulnerability/","title":"Accidentally found a vulnerability in a crypto wallet and made $1,000"},"https://akrisanov.com/custom-user-ldap-filter-in-keycloak/":{"body":"One of the ways to synchronize users via a third-party provider with Keycloak is a mechanism\ncalled User Federation. It allows, using Kerberos or LDAP protocol, to pull user entries from your\ncorporate authentication storage. However, if your organization is big enough to have a complex\nstructure and there are a lot of users in the user directory, it could be challenging to get only\na subset of the accounts that belong to different organization units.\nFor example, Active Directory models a tree-based structure using the following entities:\nCN = Common Name\nOU = Organizational Unit\nDC = Domain Component\nAll the distinguished names can be found in the official documentation\nprovided by Microsoft.\nTo configure a new User Federation in Keycloak, it's required to specify a User DN.\nThis distinguished name is the base object in the directory information tree where the search\nbegins forming candidates for pulling authentication entries. Therefore, we need to know how to\nconstruct the User DN.\nThe base option that an Active Directory administrator could use to create user accounts is to\norganize them under organizational units:\nEven if your organizational unit has a complex structure, it's still relatively easy for Keycloak\nto find user entries inside it – just activate the Search Scope: Subtree setting when configuring\nthe user federation. In large organizations, the Active Directory structure can get quite messy.\nInstead of using clear distinguished names, administrators do something surprising even to them.\nHow about putting entries under CN in different organizational units?\nThis is what I encountered while working on corporate user authentication for a media platform's CMS.\nUser entries of the editors were grouped via the Common Name. So, there is no way to define User DN\nin the way I've mentioned in the example above. Fortunately, the LDAP connection allows providing\na filter for Active Directory. In my case, writing the filter to select all of the members of the\nCMS_EDITOR group was enough to solve a problem:\nMoreover, the Custom User LDAP Filter setting in Keycloak supports logical operators like or\nwith |, and I could use it for finding not only the members of the editor staff but also\nCMS admins, guests, etc.","description":"Keycloak allows configuring a custom LDAP user filter for User Federation to select a subset of user entries in Active Directory.","id":"https://akrisanov.com/custom-user-ldap-filter-in-keycloak/","title":"Synchronizing Users From LDAP With Keycloak Using AD Filters"},"https://akrisanov.com/dotnet-list-vulnerable-packages/":{"body":"Some time ago, I was working in a company that was building a SaaS that was written in .NET.\nThe code base was a decade old, and like many companies using Microsoft technologies,\nit had been through a few framework upgrades.

All goes well, and I manage\nto deploy some changes to the backend. It's Friday afternoon, so I still have time to do\na rollback if I've made a mistake. But nothing suspicious has been observed during the day,\nand I leave the office for the weekend.\nThe fun begins on Sunday. Because I'm in charge of the project, I'm the one who is on-call.\nI get a call from our support team telling me that the web application isn't responding from time\nto time and that they're getting complaints from customers.\nThe first thing I do is open my browser to check what users are seeing. Surprisingly, a web page\nloads just fine. I hit refresh – same result. Then I turn off Wi-Fi on my iPhone and open\nSafari – 504 error. It's a Nginx page. Now it is something.\nSimplified diagram of the project architecture\nI open the monitoring and observe no high load. CPU usage is low, more than 50% of memory is free,\nplenty of free disk space on each of the virtual machines, no spikes in the network bandwidth.\nLooking at the Nginx logs only proves that there's a gateway timeout error related to the backend.\nI should check the application backend logs. Nothing there, no errors at all.\nAt this point, I start to blame the network and call the network infrastructure team.\nThese guys work on an organisational level and potentially can see what I can't. After spending\nan hour investigating together, we see nothing. It's already Sunday evening, and\nI'm almost hopeless.\nI decide to take a break and go for a walk. When I'm back, I try to ssh to a VM again. Suddenly,\nI notice a few seconds of delay before I can type my commands into a terminal. \"It can't be DNS\",\nI say to myself. To prove it, I ping a public domain from our network. Again, a few seconds of\ndelay and the network packets are flying without a hitch.\n\"If DNS was down, the infrastructure team would notice.\", I continue to reason.\nBefore escalating the situation further to upper management, I choose to check the DNS\nconfiguration on the backend virtual machines.\nThe /etc/resolv.conf is a DNS resolver configuration file. It contains records in the following format:\nIn my developer's mind, a Linux machine receives these records at boot time and caches them.\nThis file is then queried to resolve domains. What could possibly go wrong? Well, I ask the\ninfrastructure team about the IP addresses I see in /etc/resolv.conf and get a surprising\nanswer: \"The IP addresses are DNS load balancers and the first one in the list is currently down\".\nHearing this, I begin to understand why the ssh and initial ping delays are happening.\nThe first DNS load balancer is queried, but because it's down, it doesn't respond, and\nthe resolution continues with the second IP address.\nI remove the first nameserver from /etc/resolv.conf and drop the DNS cache on each of the VMs.\nAfter a few seconds, the 504 error and the gateway timeout disappear. In the morning, we'll\ndiscuss the incident with the infrastructure team and senior management. Fun week ahead.\nIt's not DNS\nThere's no way it's DNS\nIt was DNS\nOld Japanese Haiku","description":"The story about the DNS resolver, Linux VMs, experienced infrastructure team, and me troubleshooting an incident happened on Sunday morning.","id":"https://akrisanov.com/it-is-not-dns/","title":"My \"It's not DNS\" story"},"https://akrisanov.com/links/":{"body":"","description":"","id":"https://akrisanov.com/links/","title":""},"https://akrisanov.com/multi-arch-docker-images/":{"body":"At work, I am involved in the development of a machine learning SDK and cloud services for\nprivacy and data protection. Like almost every company in this space, we rely heavily on\nPython's scientific ecosystem. Because it's quite mature and depends on native library\ndevelopment that started years ago, getting these packages to work on new architectures\ncan be tedious.\nI am one of the few developers on our team who has stuck with MacOS and have a Macbook Pro\nwith M1 chip. There is no easy way for me to bootstrap our development environment in a matter\nof minutes. I have to use Conda, install specific versions of Python packages, patch some native\nlibraries, and even create a symlink from an OS-specific package to its generic name\n(I'm talking to you, Tensorflow). People on the x86_64 architecture generally won't have\nthis problem – almost every package we use comes with a pre-built wheel for a chosen OS.\nMoreover, to install the SDK as a dependency of, say, an HTTP API service, I had to assemble\nit from sources: pip install -e '.'\nA few months ago we didn't even support the Arm64 architecture at a build level. This changed when\nI introduced a Github Action pipeline to build Python wheels for Linux x86_64, aarch64, and universal.\nInstead of manually compiling some native libraries on my machine, I moved the work to GitHub and\nits Linux instances. From that moment on, I could just get the package from a private PyPI registry.\nThe sad truth is that I still use Conda and sometimes patch one or two transitive dependencies for\nmy M1 chip. But other than that, no hard times to date.\nToday I needed to distribute a newly created API service with the SDK inside as a Docker image.\nAnd I haven't found an easy way to define a Dockerfile that can be built and run on\nApple Silicon without Conda:\nAs you can see, the manifest is quite verbose. It also adds the Conda binaries and related\nfiles to a release image. It is a price that must be paid.\nFortunately, for Linux, we don't need all of this machinery:\nThe question now is how to build Docker images for both architectures on a Mac.\nThis is where Docker comes in. Docker Desktop officially supports building multi-arch images\nfor Arm and x86. Learning this, I was able to\nadd a few targets to my Makefile to quickly build images:\nDocker image built for the amd64 architecture\nOne can say, it's so much hassle for doing all of this locally and a proper CI can solve such\na case easily.

Someone suggests \"add more GPUs\", someone else says\n\"the prompts got longer\", and the discussion goes in circles.\nThe fastest way to stop guessing is to watch a small set of vLLM metrics and interpret them consistently.\nThis post is a practical playbook for software and AI engineers:\nwhat each metric really tells you\nhow to query it in Prometheus\nwhat actions typically fix the problem\nIt's intentionally opinionated and optimized for on-call reality.\nHow vLLM metrics are named\nvLLM exports Prometheus metrics with the vllm: prefix. When Prometheus scrapes them, the colon becomes an underscore.\nvllm:num_requests_running becomes vllm_num_requests_running\nAlso pay attention to metric types, because they decide how you query:\nLatency metrics are histograms (*_seconds_bucket). You compute percentiles with histogram_quantile().\nThroughput metrics are counters (*_total). You compute rates with rate().\nState / saturation metrics are gauges. You graph them directly and alert on thresholds.\nOne more thing: vLLM shows you what happens inside the inference engine. For end-to-end production visibility,\nyou still need gateway metrics (HTTP status codes, upstream latency, timeouts) and infrastructure metrics\n(GPU clocks/thermals/memory).\nThe two latency numbers that define user experience\nIn practice, you can reduce \"LLM feels slow\" to two metrics:\nTTFT (Time To First Token) — how quickly the user sees anything\nMetric: vllm:time_to_first_token_seconds\nIncludes queueing + prefill\nThis is the metric that makes chat feel \"snappy\" or \"dead\"\nTPOT (Time Per Output Token) — how fast text streams once it starts\nMetric: vllm:time_per_output_token_seconds\nMostly decode phase\nThis is what users perceive as \"typing speed\"\nThere are also two supporting latency metrics that help you pinpoint the cause:\nQueue Time: vllm:request_queue_time_seconds\nE2E latency: vllm:e2e_request_latency_seconds\nPromQL: the percentile queries you'll actually use\nP95 TTFT\nP99 TPOT\nP95 Queue Time\nvLLM reports latencies in seconds. If your brain works in milliseconds, just set the Grafana panel unit to Time → milliseconds (ms).\nThe interpretation shortcut\nThis is the fastest diagnostic rule I know:\nQueue Time grows, TPOT stays stable → you're short on capacity (not enough vLLM replicas / GPU capacity)\nTPOT grows → generation slowed down (often long contexts, GPU contention, throttling, or overly aggressive concurrency)\nKeep that in your head. It prevents most \"random tuning\".\nThroughput: are we doing useful work?\nLatency tells you what users feel. Throughput tells you whether your system is doing real work.\nvLLM exposes token counters:\nPrompt (input) tokens: vllm:prompt_tokens_total\nGenerated (output) tokens: vllm:generation_tokens_total\nPromQL\nInput tokens per second\nOutput tokens per second\nIf output tokens/s drops while traffic stays similar, you're usually looking at cache pressure,\nswapping, or too much concurrency.\nSaturation &amp; concurrency: how close are we to the cliff?\nWhen a system degrades, it rarely does it politely. For vLLM, the \"cliff\" is typically KV cache pressure and swapping.\nRequest state (scheduler pressure)\nRunning: vllm:num_requests_running — requests actively executing on GPU\nWaiting: vllm:num_requests_waiting — queue size; if it's consistently &gt; 0, you're operating at/above capacity\nSwapped: vllm:num_requests_swapped — requests evicted to CPU RAM (this is bad)\nIf you only alert on one gauge, make it this:\nAny swapped requests (num_requests_swapped &gt; 0) should be treated as a production incident.\nKV cache pressure (the silent killer)\nGPU cache usage: vllm:gpu_cache_usage_perc (0.0–1.0)\nUnder sustained load, a stable zone is often 0.7–0.9\nIf it sits at 1.0, swapping becomes likely\nCPU cache usage: vllm:cpu_cache_usage_perc\nThe reason this matters: once swapping starts, you'll see brutal latency spikes because you're moving blocks between GPU and CPU.\nErrors: why requests finish (and what \"abort\" usually means)\nvLLM tracks why requests stop via:\nvllm:finished_request_total{finish_reason=\"...\"}\nCommon reasons:\nstop — normal completion (EOS)\nlength — hit max_tokens\nabort — cancelled by user or failed due to an error\nPromQL: breakdown by finish reason\nWhat I've seen in production:\nSpikes in length often mean your max_tokens default is too low for a real workload\nSpikes in abort often correlate with gateway timeouts, client disconnects, or engine-level failures\nThe \"golden signals\" dashboard for vLLM\nIf you want one dashboard that's worth opening during an incident, build it around these signals:\nP95 TTFT — responsiveness\nP99 TPOT — generation speed stability\nQueue size (num_requests_waiting) — capacity pressure\nSwapped requests — must be zero\nGPU KV cache usage — predictive saturation\nToken throughput — real work (input/output tokens per second)\nA practical Grafana dashboard JSON\nYou can import this as a starting point:\nAlerts that save you before users start complaining\nYou don't need 30 alerts.

Each request’s KV-cache is divided into blocks (for example, 16 or 32 tokens per block).\nNo need for physical continuity. These blocks can live anywhere in VRAM – they don’t have to be next to each other.\nVirtual addressing with a Block Table. vLLM keeps a mapping from logical token order to physical memory blocks on the GPU.\nAllocate memory only when needed. New blocks are allocated only when new tokens are generated – no upfront over-reservation.\nThis single change unlocks most of vLLM’s performance gains.\nKey Effects of Paged KV-cache\nAlmost no external fragmentation\nBecause blocks don’t need to be contiguous, free memory can be reused efficiently instead of becoming unusable holes.\nMinimal internal fragmentation\nOnly the last block of a sequence may be partially empty. With reasonable block sizes, memory loss is typically below 4%.\nMuch larger batch sizes\nBetter memory efficiency means more concurrent requests per GPU, which is the main driver of performance on modern GPUs.\nMassive throughput gains\nIn practice, this enables:\n2–4× throughput vs. TGI\nUp to ~24× vs. naïve Hugging Face serving setups\nTrue continuous batching\nNew requests can be added as soon as finished ones free blocks – no need to wait for a full batch boundary.\nMemory sharing (prefix / prompt caching)\nMultiple requests can point to the same physical blocks for shared prefixes (system prompts, long examples).\nCopy-on-write when sequences diverge\nIf you generate multiple completions from the same prompt, new blocks are allocated only when outputs differ.\nThis can save up to ~55% of KV-cache memory.\nBetter TTFT under load (indirectly)\nPagedAttention doesn’t speed up the first token itself, but higher throughput clears queues faster –\nreducing queue time, which users perceive as better TTFT.\nGraceful preemption and swapping\nIf VRAM runs low, individual blocks can be swapped to CPU memory instead of crashing the server with OOM.\nNo recomputation\nUnlike approaches that drop KV-cache under pressure, PagedAttention preserves progress and resumes generation\nwithout re-processing the prompt.\nBlock Size: A Subtle but Important Knob\nBlock size affects:\nInternal fragmentation\nMetadata and indexing overhead\nEviction and preemption behavior (if used)\nSmaller blocks = better memory efficiency, higher overhead.\nLarger blocks = lower overhead, more wasted tail space.\nThere’s no universal best value – it depends on workload shape.\nA Note About Prefill vs Decode\nIt’s important to separate these phases:\nPrefill\nOften compute- or memory-bound\nCost grows with input sequence length\nDecode\nUsually memory-bandwidth-bound\nHeavily dependent on KV-cache efficiency and batching\nTTFT (Time to First Token) = queue time + prefill latency\nPagedAttention mainly improves decode throughput.\nSo if you see this pattern:\ntokens/sec ↑\np99 TTFT unchanged (or worse)\nYou optimized decode, but you’re still bottlenecked on queueing or prefill.\nWhy vLLM Became the Default Choice\nvLLM didn’t win because of a single micro-optimization.\nIt won because PagedAttention fundamentally changes how GPU memory is used for LLM serving.\nIf you care about:\nhigh throughput\nstable latency under load\nefficient use of expensive GPUs\nthen understanding vLLM is no longer optional – it’s baseline knowledge for modern LLM infrastructure.","description":"Why traditional LLM serving wastes GPU memory – and how vLLM’s PagedAttention model enables larger batches, higher throughput, and more predictable latency.","id":"https://akrisanov.com/vllm/","title":"Why vLLM Scales: Paging the KV-Cache for Faster LLM Inference"}},"docInfo":{"https://akrisanov.com/":{"body":0,"description":0,"title":0},"https://akrisanov.com/about/":{"body":191,"description":0,"title":0},"https://akrisanov.com/archive/":{"body":0,"description":0,"title":0},"https://akrisanov.com/blog/":{"body":0,"description":0,"title":0},"https://akrisanov.com/choosing-kafka/":{"body":168,"description":23,"title":6},"https://akrisanov.com/convert-flac-to-apple-lossless-with-ffmpeg/":{"body":119,"description":14,"title":5},"https://akrisanov.com/crypto-wallet-vulnerability/":{"body":324,"description":11,"title":7},"https://akrisanov.com/custom-user-ldap-filter-in-keycloak/":{"body":215,"description":15,"title":7},"https://akrisanov.com/dotnet-list-vulnerable-packages/":{"body":187,"description":8,"title":5},"https://akrisanov.com/images/":{"body":0,"description":0,"title":0},"https://akrisanov.com/it-is-not-dns/":{"body":397,"description":13,"title":3},"https://akrisanov.com/links/":{"body":0,"description":0,"title":0},"https://akrisanov.com/multi-arch-docker-images/":{"body":258,"description":10,"title":6},"https://akrisanov.com/offline/":{"body":10,"description":0,"title":2},"https://akrisanov.com/pages/":{"body":0,"description":0,"title":0},"https://akrisanov.com/understand-how-services-are-run-and-operate-in-production/":{"body":185,"description":15,"title":5},"https://akrisanov.com/using-github-actions-to-generate-a-lockfile-for-python-project/":{"body":191,"description":9,"title":7},"https://akrisanov.com/uv/":{"body":369,"description":17,"title":8},"https://akrisanov.com/vllm-metrics/":{"body":791,"description":22,"title":3},"https://akrisanov.com/vllm/":{"body":522,"description":17,"title":8}},"length":20},"lang":"English"}

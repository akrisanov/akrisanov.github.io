I'm Andrey\nI'm a backend engineer with over 15 years of experience building and scaling SaaS products.\nCurrently, I'm the CTO at planfact.io â€” a profitable B2B company helping thousands of small\nand midsize businesses manage their finances efficiently.\nAt Planfact, I lead a 25-person engineering team and stay hands-on with architecture, infrastructure, and backend systems.\nOver the past years, Iâ€™ve driven key transformations:\n\nMigration from on-premise Windows Server to Kubernetes on Linux, improving scalability and reliability\nDesign and rollout of a full observability stack (ClickStack + Sentry) achieving 99.998% uptime\nAdoption of Terraform + Ansible for reproducible IaC environments\nReference modular architecture for all backend services (.NET 9)\nMigration of core services from .NET 6 â†’ 9, Angular 15 â†’ 19\nBuilding a remote-first engineering culture with RFCs, async communication, and strong ownership\n\nTransition and Focus\nMy current professional focus is on AI Infrastructure and Inference Engineering â€” where backend systems,\ncloud-native infrastructure, and machine learning serving converge.\nIâ€™m building hands-on expertise in:\n\nLLM and model serving (vLLM, Triton, Ray Serve)\nObservability and performance for GPU inference workloads\nDistributed systems and scalable compute pipelines\nInfrastructure as Code, container orchestration, and reproducible environments\n\nMy long-term goal is to contribute to frontier AI labs and help scale intelligent applications from research\nto reliable production

Apart from general curiosity, I was interested in\nhow they achieved security in a browser, especially in the age of extensions and\nclient-side vulnerabilities.\nIt turned out that when a user logged in, the wallet application (built in React) generated a set\nof public and private keys and stored them in the browser's local storage. With my experience of\nbuilding authentication and authorization in distributed systems, I knew this was not the best\nthing to do â€“ in general, it's easy for a browser extension and client-side code to read data\nfrom local storage 1.\nTo prove this, I decided to write a simple extension for Chrome that would retrieve keys from a victim's browser and send them to my\nanonymous email address.\nThe root directory of my pickpocket extension looked like this:\n\nThe main files are the manifest.json and content.js. The former is essential for installing the extension.\n\nemail.min.js is just a client library from one of the cloud services that allows you to send\nemail directly from a browser without any server code. index.html is a blank HTML page that\ndisplays nothing. The wallet hijacking logic lived in the content.js file:\n\nYes, such a dummy script.\nI packed all four files into a zip archive and kindly asked my friend, who also had\na wallet at https://wallet.***.org, to install my creation in his browser\n(pretending to do some social engineering). Before doing so, I told him about my findings and\nthe theory I was trying to prove. He was happy to help, and the public and private keys of\nthis wallet account appeared in my inbox a few seconds after the browser extension was installed.\nNext, I saved the keys to local storage in my browser and opened the wallet website.\nSurprisingly, my friend's crypto-wallet balance was available to me, along with an option to\nwithdraw the funds. During a Zoom call with my victim friend, I transferred some of his funds to\nan anonymous account and back. It was mind-blowing! A new, promising blockchain that had recently\nclosed an investment round had a major vulnerability in its wallet. Worst of all, they had 2-factor\nauthentication for users. Of course, not many people would activate it right away, and many didn't.\nAs an ethical developer, I created a vulnerability report, including the source code of\nthe browser extension and my thoughts on how to improve the security of the web application.\nIt was sent directly to the security team's email address on 18th of January. A few days later,\nI had a call with the CISO of the blockchain protocol, who assured me that they were aware of\nthe issue and would address it in the next release.

It allows, using Kerberos or LDAP protocol, to pull user entries from your\ncorporate authentication storage. However, if your organization is big enough to have a complex\nstructure and there are a lot of users in the user directory, it could be challenging to get only\na subset of the accounts that belong to different organization units.\nFor example, Active Directory models a tree-based structure using the following entities:\n\nCN = Common Name\nOU = Organizational Unit\nDC = Domain Component\n\nAll the distinguished names can be found in the official documentation\nprovided by Microsoft.\nTo configure a new User Federation in Keycloak, it's required to specify a User DN.\nThis distinguished name is the base object in the directory information tree where the search\nbegins forming candidates for pulling authentication entries. Therefore, we need to know how to\nconstruct the User DN.\nThe base option that an Active Directory administrator could use to create user accounts is to\norganize them under organizational units:\n\nEven if your organizational unit has a complex structure, it's still relatively easy for Keycloak\nto find user entries inside it â€“ just activate the Search Scope: Subtree setting when configuring\nthe user federation. In large organizations, the Active Directory structure can get quite messy.\nInstead of using clear distinguished names, administrators do something surprising even to them.\nHow about putting entries under CN in different organizational units?\nThis is what I encountered while working on corporate user authentication for a media platform's CMS.\nUser entries of the editors were grouped via the Common Name. So, there is no way to define User DN\nin the way I've mentioned in the example above. Fortunately, the LDAP connection allows providing\na filter for Active Directory. In my case, writing the filter to select all of the members of the\nCMS_EDITOR group was enough to solve a problem:\n\nMoreover, the Custom User LDAP Filter setting in Keycloak supports logical operators like or\nwith |, and I could use it for finding not only the members of the editor staff but also\nCMS admins, guests, etc.\n","description":"Keycloak allows configuring a custom LDAP user filter for User Federation to select a subset of user entries in Active Directory.","id":"https://akrisanov.com/custom-user-ldap-filter-in-keycloak/","title":"Synchronizing Users From LDAP With Keycloak Using AD Filters"},"https://akrisanov.com/dotnet-list-vulnerable-packages/":{"body":"Some time ago, I was working in a company that was building a SaaS that was written in .NET.\nThe code base was a decade old, and like many companies using Microsoft technologies,\nit had been through a few framework upgrades. The intent was to move to modern technologies and\nrefactor outdated components, but the execution was rather poor. By the time I put on my engineering\nmanager's hat, many of the NuGet packages in the solution were out of date and even deprecated.\nIn Python and Go projects, I rely heavily on linting, static analysis, and formatting tools.\nNot having these essentials would make me and my teams less productive.

The project I'm taking over doesn't\neven have a complete team yet, which means I'll be wearing all sorts of hats until I hire someone\nand delegate work. You could say, I'm the only \"developer\" on the team. Also, the code base is\nalready serving users, and the services are part of a lead generation funnel for one of the grocery\nnetworks. So if something goes down, the company loses potential customers and revenue. The fact\nthat the project was developed by an outsourced team that has already left without handing over\nproper documentation makes things more complicated and fragile.\nIn a few days, I try to understand how the services are run in production, write missing README\nand system design papers, and create initial tasks for maintenance. All goes well, and I manage\nto deploy some changes to the backend. It's Friday afternoon, so I still have time to do\na rollback if I've made a mistake. But nothing suspicious has been observed during the day,\nand I leave the office for the weekend.\nThe fun begins on Sunday. Because I'm in charge of the project, I'm the one who is on-call.\nI get a call from our support team telling me that the web application isn't responding from time\nto time and that they're getting complaints from customers.\nThe first thing I do is open my browser to check what users are seeing. Surprisingly, a web page\nloads just fine. I hit refresh â€“ same result. Then I turn off Wi-Fi on my iPhone and open\nSafari â€“ 504 error. It's a Nginx page.

CPU usage is low, more than 50% of memory is free,\nplenty of free disk space on each of the virtual machines, no spikes in the network bandwidth.\nLooking at the Nginx logs only proves that there's a gateway timeout error related to the backend.\nI should check the application backend logs. Nothing there, no errors at all.\nAt this point, I start to blame the network and call the network infrastructure team.\nThese guys work on an organisational level and potentially can see what I can't. After spending\nan hour investigating together, we see nothing. It's already Sunday evening, and\nI'm almost hopeless.\nI decide to take a break and go for a walk. When I'm back, I try to ssh to a VM again. Suddenly,\nI notice a few seconds of delay before I can type my commands into a terminal. \"It can't be DNS\",\nI say to myself. To prove it, I ping a public domain from our network. Again, a few seconds of\ndelay and the network packets are flying without a hitch.\n\"If DNS was down, the infrastructure team would notice.\", I continue to reason.\nBefore escalating the situation further to upper management, I choose to check the DNS\nconfiguration on the backend virtual machines.\nThe /etc/resolv.conf is a DNS resolver configuration file. It contains records in the following format:\n\nIn my developer's mind, a Linux machine receives these records at boot time and caches them.\nThis file is then queried to resolve domains. What could possibly go wrong? Well, I ask the\ninfrastructure team about the IP addresses I see in /etc/resolv.conf and get a surprising\nanswer: \"The IP addresses are DNS load balancers and the first one in the list is currently down\".\nHearing this, I begin to understand why the ssh and initial ping delays are happening.\nThe first DNS load balancer is queried, but because it's down, it doesn't respond, and\nthe resolution continues with the second IP address.\nI remove the first nameserver from /etc/resolv.conf and drop the DNS cache on each of the VMs.\nAfter a few seconds, the 504 error and the gateway timeout disappear. In the morning, we'll\ndiscuss the incident with the infrastructure team and senior management.

There is no easy way for me to bootstrap our development environment in a matter\nof minutes. I have to use Conda, install specific versions of Python packages, patch some native\nlibraries, and even create a symlink from an OS-specific package to its generic name\n(I'm talking to you, Tensorflow). People on the x86_64 architecture generally won't have\nthis problem â€“ almost every package we use comes with a pre-built wheel for a chosen OS.\nMoreover, to install the SDK as a dependency of, say, an HTTP API service, I had to assemble\nit from sources: pip install -e '.'\nA few months ago we didn't even support the Arm64 architecture at a build level. This changed when\nI introduced a Github Action pipeline to build Python wheels for Linux x86_64, aarch64, and universal.\nInstead of manually compiling some native libraries on my machine, I moved the work to GitHub and\nits Linux instances.

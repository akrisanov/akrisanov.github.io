Personal website built with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) and customized [Abridge] theme.

The site is multilingual, supporting English and Russian.
However, not all blog posts are translated into both languages.

## Writing Posts

First, install Zola if you haven't already:

```bash
brew install zola
```

Then, create a new post:

```bash
cp content/_template content/new-post.md
```

Serve content with live reload:

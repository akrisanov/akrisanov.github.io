## Hi, I'm Andrey

I'm a **backend** engineer with over 15 years of experience building and scaling SaaS products.
Currently, I'm the **CTO at [planfact.io](https://planfact.io)** — a profitable B2B company helping thousands of small
and midsize businesses manage their finances efficiently.

At Planfact, I lead a 25-person engineering team and stay hands-on with **architecture, infrastructure, and backend systems**.
Over the past years, I’ve driven key transformations:

- Migration from on-premise Windows Server to **Kubernetes on Linux**, improving scalability and reliability
- Design and rollout of a full **observability stack (ClickStack + Sentry)** achieving 99.998% uptime
- Adoption of **Terraform + Ansible** for reproducible IaC environments
- Reference modular architecture for all backend services (**.NET 9**)
- Migration of core services from **.NET 6 → 9**, **Angular 15 → 19**
- Building a **remote-first engineering culture** with RFCs, async communication, and strong ownership

## Transition and Focus

My current professional focus is on **AI Infrastructure and Inference Engineering** — where backend systems,
cloud-native infrastructure, and machine learning serving converge.

I’m building hands-on expertise in:

- **LLM and model serving** (vLLM, Triton, Ray Serve)
- **Observability and performance** for GPU inference workloads
- **Distributed systems** and **scalable compute pipelines**
- **Infrastructure as Code**, container orchestration, and reproducible environments

My long-term goal is to **contribute to frontier AI labs** and help scale intelligent applications from research
to reliable production systems.

## Background

Before Planfact, I worked in startups and enterprise environments across **Germany and Russia** — from fintech and
data privacy to retail and media.

Some highlights include:

- **Statice.ai** — Designed backend and infra components for a data privacy platform (Python, FastAPI, K8s, GCP)
- **X5 Retail Group** — Launched *food.ru*, #1 media platform about food in Russia, awarded *Runet Prize 2021*
- **Clark.de (Series A)** — Built integrations with **N26 Bank**, enabling in-app insurance sign-up
- **Payler** — Designed and launched a payment gateway, transforming the company into an international payment provider

## Education

Master’s degree in **Applied Mathematics and Computer Science** from *Bryansk State University*.
Since 2024, I’ve been continuously expanding my knowledge in **ML systems** and **AI infrastructure design**.

## Hi, I'm Andrey

I'm an engineering manager focused on shipping products and delivering value to customers.

With experience working in distributed teams and remotely, I'm an advocate of transparency and
trust, asynchronous communication, thorough documentation, and pragmatism.

Collaborative software, data processing, applied AI, and fintech are my main areas of interest.

I'm currently a CTO at [planfact.io](planfact.io) SaaS, helping the company to scale its engineering
team and processes for the next stage of growth.

## Past work

I have been working in the technology industry for over a decade now. The first significant
commercial project I developed was a desktop application for a network of pharmacies in Ireland.
It was written in C#, WPF, and the .NET Framework. I was in my third year at university at the time.

Since graduating, I have worked for a few small companies in my hometown, international startups
both locally and abroad, and one of the largest retail companies in the EMEA region, using various
technologies from Objective-C to Python and often managing projects and people.

I have a degree in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science from Bryansk State University.
I have been fascinated by computers since I saw one in 2000. That's why my programming skills are
better than my understanding and knowledge of mathematics â€“ such a pity.

## This site

This website is online since July 2023. It is another attempt to write about things related to my
career and topics that interest me in English. The content varies from short essays to technical
articles with lots of code snippets. I only post when I want to express myself, reflect on
an experience, or document useful aspects of my work. So please don't expect regular posts here.

Cheers!
